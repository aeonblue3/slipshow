# removeSlide

**Type**: `Function`, **Returns**: `Object` (Instance of Revolver)

The `removeSlide` method is used internally to remove slides from the slides array. You may use this same method to remove a slide, given by index number, from the array of slides. This method does not remove the slide from DOM.

```javascript
var index = 1;

mySlider.removeSlide(index);
```
